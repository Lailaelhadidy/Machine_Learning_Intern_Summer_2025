# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a real-world hotel booking dataset. The main goal is to uncover patterns and insights behind booking cancellations, enabling hotels to make data-driven decisions for improving customer retention, revenue optimization, and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze key factors influencing booking cancellations.
- Visualize trends related to:
  - Lead time
  - Room type
  - Reservation month
  - Total nights booked
  - Average price per night
- Deliver actionable insights and visual storytelling using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 🐍
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- .py script
- PowerPoint for storytelling and presentation

## 📊 Key Findings
- Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates.
- Specific room types (e.g., Room_Type 6) are more prone to cancellations.
- Seasonal peaks (e.g., July) show higher cancellation risk.
- Longer stays tend to get canceled more often.
- High-priced bookings have slightly more volatility in cancellation behavior.

## 📁 Files Included
- `hotel.csv` – Original dataset
- `Task1-EDA.pptx` – Final storytelling dashboard
- 5 python files for data cleaning & visualization
